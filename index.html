								</a></h2>
									<p>In a competitive telecommunications industry, our client faced significant challenges with customer churn, affecting their £16M annual revenue and market position. With a churn rate of 26.54%, we identified that customers with less than 1 year of subscription, month-to-month contracts, and those using electronic checks were at the highest risk. Fiber optic users (43.96%) and those opting for paperless billing (59.22%) also showed elevated churn rates.

										We recommended incentivizing long-term contracts with discounts and added services to reduce churn among month-to-month subscribers. Enhancing onboarding and customer support for new customers, who had the highest churn rate, was crucial. Promoting more secure payment methods like credit cards, which have lower churn rates than electronic checks, was also advised. Additionally, improving the quality of Fiber optic services and reevaluating the paperless billing process were key strategies.
										
										By implementing these data-driven strategies, the company aimed to significantly reduce churn, enhance customer retention, and increase their £16M annual revenue, demonstrating the power of targeted solutions in addressing business challenges and ensuring sustainable growth.
